# Jetfm
A basic Last.fm client made with Jetpack compose (and a little free time).

This project serves as an example and a bit of experimentation with Jetpack Compose.

I will be updating the project frequently. Since Jetpack Compose is still in alpha, many things may change or there may be other composables and tools that can help.

What I have achieved with this project:
- Basic UI
- ViewModel -> State
- Routes with [compose-router](https://github.com/zsoltk/compose-router)
- Integrate Last.fm API
- Infinite scroll
- Show remote images with [accompanist coil package](https://github.com/chrisbanes/accompanist/tree/main/coil)
